        <h2 id="aboutSubhead">I am a proud resident of Los Angeles, my hometown, but St. Louis comes as a close second. Currently, I study marketing at Washington University in St. Louis, with minors in computer science and human computer interaction. My passion for creating aesthetic and engaging products started in high school, where I dedicated myself to designing for our yearbook.

        Fun fact: Due to my interest in UI/UX, I have taken courses across all four departments in college: engineering, arts &  sciences, business, and design. Needless to say, my advisor was more than perplexed when he first saw my schedule.
